DONE
1. Change the Vocab to create dictionary from only the annotations from train: Duke
2. Preprocess image - randomly crop a square section to use as input: Adnan
3. Validation Train 80-20 split: Sutej
4. Figure out why the last dimension is left out in our mode: Sutej
5. Get the Vanilla RNN code in place: Adnan 
6. LSTM cell based on teacher forcing: Sutej  
7. Convert from feature to sentence: Duke
8. Stochastic generation: Duke,Sutej
9. Deterministic generation: Duke,Sutej
10.LSTM cell based on feeding previous prediction: Sutej
11.Code the validation function:Chandhini
12.Save the best model based on validation loss:Chandhini
13.Store validation and training loss at each epoch:Chandhini
14.Training Validation curves
