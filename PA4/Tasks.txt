# Change the Vocab to use the right annotations - Done
# Change the size to make collate work - Done

# In train 
    # Validation Train split - Done
    # Get validation loss while training
    # Save the best model based on validation loss
    # Generate captions code, stochastic and deterministic
    # Check if the model is learning every epoch - print captions every epoch
    # Figure out the teacher forced part in train
    # Store validation and training loss at each epoch

# In test
    # Save the caption for each of the test image ids to a file, 
    # Report cross entropy loss and perplexity score

# Metrics
    # Training Validation curves
    # Sanity check BLEU score code provided 
    # Perplexity code

# Get the RNN code in place 
# Figure out the word2vec part 
# Figure out why the last dimension is left out in our model
